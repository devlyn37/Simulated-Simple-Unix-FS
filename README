This is a simulated file system that was originally for an operating systems course.
It emulates a UNIX file system with a virtual disk that must be contained within a single file around 2 Mb 
Large.

The code for the system itself is located in the io folder, while code for testing is 
located within the apps folder. The file that contains the silumated disk for the system
is called vdisk and is located in the disk folder along with some files for testing.

I'm keeping this around so whenever I need to brush up on C or remember how file systems
work at a very basic level I can make small improvements to this.

To run the test just run the shellScript.sh

TO-DO
- Fix the way debug print statements work
- Check and fix all the memory leaks
- Organize the code in a way thats more natural
- write more thorough tests
- Try to make this useful in some way
